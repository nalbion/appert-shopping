# appert-shopping
[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/github/nalbion/appert-shopping/master.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/nalbion/appert-shopping?branch=master)

- Test the API at [https://appert-shopping.herokuapp.com/swagger](https://appert-shopping.herokuapp.com/swagger)
- Each user is automatically assigned a `cartId` cookie which is used in subsequent requests.
- The shopping cart API supports promotions which can be externally configured.
 Various instances of `freebie` etc can be configured, and new promotion types can be added without modifications to the `PromotionsService` code.

## TODO
- authorisation - users should be able to (optionally) log in and access the cart they were using anonymously or from a different device.
- checkout & payment
- load/persist to DB, database migration schemas
- atomic DB transactions on take/return item from inventory
- CI/CD pipeline (most supporting scripts are provided)
- Monitor [http://localhost:9020/api/health](http://localhost:9020/api/health) & update to ping DB. If the optional query string `?version=0.0.1` does not match the build version a HTTP status `409` is returned.

## Usage

```bash
docker build -t nalbion/appert-shopping .
docker run --rm -p 9020:9020 nalbion/appert-shopping
```

Alternatively, use the npm scripts:

```bash
npm run docker:build
npm run docker:run
```

When running, API documentation is available at [http://localhost:9020/swagger](http://localhost:9020/swagger). Example requests are provided in the "Try it out" sections.

The schema `appert-shopping-api.yml` is generated by `npm run generate-schema` and is also available at [http://localhost:9020/swagger/spec](http://localhost:9020/swagger/spec).

### Development

```bash
npm install
npm run test:tdd
```

or
